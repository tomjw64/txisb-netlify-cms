        Hosted inside the Texas A&M Student Rec Center,  this year's TxISB
        features some of Texas' best teachers: Kari Kron and Thomas Williamson
        from Houston, as well as Kevin Nguyen and Keli Hawthorne from Austin!
        Each will be teaching two 1-hour classes, from 2-3 and 3:15-4:15


        On top of that, with 3 sets of live music from Rent Party and a DJ'd set
        that'll keep running into the late night we'll keep you literally
        dancing through history. Swingout in front of a Sherman or Stuart tank,
        Charleston past a Chaffee, or just kick back in the VIP lounge area with
        drinks and snacks, available with a donation to the museum.


        A public beginner lesson will also be held from 7-8 in the museum for
        those who wish to learn the basics of swing dancing.

        True to our name, 2020's TxISB gives you two ways to battle your fellow
        dancers: let fate decide your partner in our Mix and Match competition,
        or try to stay afloat during our Sink or Swing competition by stealing
        one of the judges before the song ends.
